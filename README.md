# ACE(LACE)-based-algorithms
This repository hosts the R code that implements ACE/LACE-based algorithms and reproduces numerical simulation results from our paper as "Zhang, X.R., Lin, D.J.K and Zheng, W. (2025). Construction of maximin distance latin hypercube designs via good lattice point sets".
